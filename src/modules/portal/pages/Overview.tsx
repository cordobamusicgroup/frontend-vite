          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            This web application is the progressive replacement for our previous "Database" platform which experienced performance issues, security concerns, and efficiency limitations.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            With this new system, we can manage everything more efficiently in a cleaner ecosystem, while automating previously manual processes such as royalty report registration. You might be surprised to learn that this was a completely manual process in the previous platform!
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Our goal is to automate all processes. While some features may take time to implement, we are extremely careful with financial details to ensure not even a decimal is incorrect. This guarantees that all reports are clear and accurate.

                As many of you know, we have migrated from Believe distribution to Kontor New Media. Until Believe royalties stop coming in, we have separated the royalties: Believe payments in the USD balance and Kontor payments in the EUR balance.
